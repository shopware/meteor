        The easiest way to provide a reproduction is by creating a new project
        in [StackBlitz](https://vite.new/vue). If this is not suitable, you can
        always provide a GitHub repository.

        The reproduction should be **minimal** - i.e. it should contain only the
        bare minimum amount of code needed to show the bug.

        Please do not just fill in a random link. The issue will be closed if no valid reproduction is provided.

        What do we need to do after opening your repro in order to make the bug happen?
        Clear and concise reproduction instructions are important for us to be able to
        triage your issue in a timely manner. Note that you can use
        [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
        to format lists and code.
