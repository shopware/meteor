Action Menus are contextual menus that reveal a list of related actions or links when triggered by a button. They help keep interfaces clean by progressively disclosing options only when needed.

Action Menus can include icons, keyboard shortcuts, external link indicators, and multiple levels, enabling quick access to relevant actions without cluttering the UI.

Action Menus are best suited for secondary or contextual actions tied to a specific object, view, or state. They should feel lightweight, predictable, and easy to scan.

## ✅ Do's

- Prioritize frequent actions, place destructive ones at the bottom.
- Keep menus short, shallow, and easy to scan.
- Maintain consistent action ordering across contexts.
- Keep the menu hierarchy shallow. Two levels, occasionally three, should be the maximum.
- Use clear, action-oriented labels, for example “Duplicate”, “Export”, or “Delete”.
- Mark destructive actions clearly. Use the item variant `critical` for actions like “Delete” or “Remove”.
- Separate destructive actions with a divider when they appear alongside non-destructive actions.
- Keep icon usage cohesive within groups. Either all items use a leading icon or none do.
- Account for platform differences in keyboard shortcuts, as the same action may use different keys across operating systems.

## ❌ Don'ts

- Don't use Action Menus for primary actions. Primary or high-frequency actions should be directly visible.
- Don't group unrelated actions or create groups without a clear purpose.
- Don't overuse dividers or groups, they reduce scannability when used excessively. Avoid too many single-item groups.
- Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning, especially for critical actions.
- Don't hide essential functionality. If an action is critical to task completion, it should not be discoverable only through an Action Menu.
