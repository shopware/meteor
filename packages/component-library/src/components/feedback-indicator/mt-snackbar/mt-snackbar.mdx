# Snackbars

Snackbars are lightweight notifications that provide quick, contextual feedback in response to user actions. They appear in the bottom-right corner of the application, stay visible for only a few seconds, and then disappear automatically, keeping the flow of work uninterrupted. Unlike banners or modals, snackbars are temporary and non-intrusive.

Snackbars should never interrupt the user’s experience. They are best suited for confirming actions, showing temporary updates, or signaling non-critical events.

There is one exception: progress snackbar. Progress snackbars remain on the screen until the action is completed or canceled. They should always be followed by a success or error snackbar to finalize the feedback.


### ✅ Do's

- Keep it short and clear. Use concise, affirmative messages (for example, “Product saved”).
- Use sentence case. Avoid unnecessary punctuation unless multiple sentences are needed.
- Confirm actions. Use snackbars to acknowledge user actions or show temporary updates.
- Provide progress feedback. Use a progress snackbar for ongoing actions, followed by a success or error snackbar.
- Use neutral, generic language. Avoid filenames or personal details.
- Apply appropriate variants. Use success, error and progress consistently.

### ❌ Don'ts

- Don’t use for critical alerts. Errors requiring immediate attention belong in banners or modals.
- Don’t overuse. Too many snackbars reduce usability and cause alert fatigue.
- Don’t overload with actions. Allow only one optional action (for example, “Undo”).
- Don’t use for persistent issues. Show banners for errors the user can resolve.
- Don't rely solely on snackbars. Always provide an alternative way to access the action. For example, “Undo” often appears alongside “Delete”.
- Don’t use vague language. Skip unclear messages like “Something happened”
