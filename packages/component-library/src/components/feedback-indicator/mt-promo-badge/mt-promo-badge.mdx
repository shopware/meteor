# Promo badge

The `Promo Badge` is a specialized version of the `Badge` component used to highlight promotional states or feature labels, such as *New, Beta, or Shopware AI*. Unlike the general `Badge`, `Promo Badge` is limited to predefined promotional variants to ensure consistent visual treatment across the product.

### ✅ Do's

---

- Use to highlight promotional elements across our products
- Keep text consistent with defined variants (New, Beta, Shopware AI, …)
- Use a `Promo Badge` sparingly to draw attention without cluttering the interface

### ❌ Don'ts

---

- Don’t use for status indicators *(e.g. Error, Success)* → use `Badge` instead
- Don’t create custom promotional variants. Stick to the predefined set for consistency
- Don't make a `Promo Badge` clickable as they are not `Buttons` or `Links`. However, showing a `Tooltip` on hover is allowed.
