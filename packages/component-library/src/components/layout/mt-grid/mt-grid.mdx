The `mt-grid-component` can be used to create simple grid layouts. The most
common use case for this component is to use it inside a `mt-card`.

For more complex layouts you should create grids with CSS.

## Usage

```vue
<template>
  <mt-card>
    <mt-grid :columns="3">
      <mt-text-field />
      <mt-text-field />
      <mt-switch />
      <mt-text-field />
      <mt-text-field />
      <mt-text-field />
    </mt-grid>
  </mt-card>
</template>
```

<Primary />

> **Note:** The `mt-grid` component is responsive by default. You don't need
> to care about adding media or container queries to make it responsive
